Want to automate monotonous task in your everyday life? Here is a python skeleton code that is build for Zillow website using Beautiful soup and Selenium.

main.py file 
To use this skeleton file for other websites, 
you must first change the link to the one you want to scrapce 
and also change the key tags as per the information you require. 

formFill.py
Here you must insert your own path to where you downloaded and saved the chrome driver file.
You must also alter the x-path depending on the website you are scraping.
